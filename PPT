Territory sales teams work on reactive, static KPIs, often interpreted manually

Existing system is rule-based, not personalized or dynamic

No mechanism to prioritize dealers or territories needing attention

Insights are retrospective, missing future risks or opportunities

Overload of raw data → harder for teams to extract actionable signals quickly


KPIs are standardized across geographies, ignoring territory-specific context

Focus on reporting, not forecasting — no use of AI/ML for dealer intelligence

Sales insights are frequency-driven (daily/weekly) vs business-impact driven

Lack of integration across data types — sales, visits, audit, competition

No feedback loop from ground teams → system does not evolve or learn
Perfect — here's a **cleaned-up version** of **Slide 4: Interview Insights** without the solution-mapping column, and only including the insights that are relevant to the solution you're building. This version focuses on what the stakeholders said, keeping it sharp and concise for presentation.
