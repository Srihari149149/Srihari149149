Territory sales teams work on reactive, static KPIs, often interpreted manually

Existing system is rule-based, not personalized or dynamic

No mechanism to prioritize dealers or territories needing attention

Insights are retrospective, missing future risks or opportunities

Overload of raw data → harder for teams to extract actionable signals quickly


KPIs are standardized across geographies, ignoring territory-specific context

Focus on reporting, not forecasting — no use of AI/ML for dealer intelligence

Sales insights are frequency-driven (daily/weekly) vs business-impact driven

Lack of integration across data types — sales, visits, audit, competition

No feedback loop from ground teams → system does not evolve or learn
Perfect — here's a **cleaned-up version** of **Slide 4: Interview Insights** without the solution-mapping column, and only including the insights that are relevant to the solution you're building. This version focuses on what the stakeholders said, keeping it sharp and concise for presentation.

### **Slide 4: Ground Truth – Interview Insights**

**Insights from Interviews with Area Managers and Field Staff (TSEs)**  
*(Shashank, Yatish, Karthik, Tharankeshavar, TSE – 14–16 April 2025)*

| Stakeholder         | Role                  | Key Insights                                                                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shashank            | AM – Ghaziabad        | - Wants OD split into active vs non-active dealers<br>- Monthly NADA target: 5% (Urban), 10% (Upcountry)<br>- Week 1 CR visit coverage as a priority KPI<br>- Shop share and product ratio KPIs (e.g., Advanced/Base)<br>- Emulsion KPIs to be tracked separately from Value/Volume |
| Yatish              | AM – Jaunpur          | - Notifications lack clear structure<br>- Wants planning data early in month, visit KPIs mid-month<br>- Emulsion, Essential Goals, Value/Volume, Collections, and Complaints ranked in priority<br>- Needs AI-predicted sales vs base and plan<br>- Wants category-level Essential Goals (e.g., adhesives, wood finishes) instead of granular items like masking tape |
| Karthik             | AM – Kanpur           | - Weekly breakdown preferred: Week 1 - dealer billing, Week 2 - product-wise report, Week 4 - overall KPIs<br>- Supports NADA and advanced ratio as KPIs |
| Tharankeshavar      | AM – Moradabad        | - Daily OD insights and top dealers needed<br>- Predictive alert for dealers expected to enter OD<br>- Dealers not billed in past 10 days is important<br>- Territory → Product → Dealer master view needed<br>- Wants monthly summaries and AI-driven recommendations<br>- Churn = 3-month emulsion drop + competitor retail audit growth |
| TSE                 | Field Staff           | - Follows OD and Emulsion-not-taken alerts<br>- Likes product ratio KPIs (e.g., shift from distemper to emulsion)<br>- Defines churn as sudden drop in sales (e.g., ₹10Cr to ₹2Cr)<br>- Adoption good among TSEs if insights remain actionable and not overly granular |

### **Slide 4: Key Interview Insights**  
_Insights from AMs and TSEs – Aligned to Predictive Engine Solution_

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Shashank (AM, West)**  
- “Want OD broken down into active vs inactive dealers.”  
- “NADA targets: 5% urban, 10% upcountry – tracked monthly.”  
- “KPIs must include advanced product ratios, shop share (counter vs AP CAGR), and Emulsion-focused metrics.”  

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Yatish (AM, South)**  
- “Give me planned vs base vs actual sales – clear and monthly.”  
- “Need predictive sales estimates with targets met/progress.”  
- “SmartCare & Adhesives should be grouped under Essential Goals – less granularity, more clarity.”  

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Karthik (AM, East)**  
- “Share insights weekly – keep it structured by week.”  
- “Week 1: Dealers billed | Week 2: Product KPIs | Week 3: FP focus | Week 4: Overall view.”  
- “Okay with NADA, advanced product ratios.”  

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Tharankeshavar (AM, South)**  
- “Churn = emulsion sales drop + competitor growth – use retail audit.”  
- “Need daily OD dealer alerts + dealers not billed in 10 days.”  
- “Limit insights to 10 max – too many notifications dilute impact.”  
- “Want consolidated views – territory → product → dealer.”  
- “App summaries + AI-based focus recommendations would help.”  

---

#### 🧑‍🔧 **TSE (Field)**  
- “OD, CR not visited, and Emulsion-not-taken alerts are most helpful.”  
- “Product shift ratios (e.g., distemper → emulsion) help pitch better.”  
- “Prefer less granularity, dropdown filters, and concise messages.”  
- “App is helpful, but Excel still rules – depends on what adds value.”

Would you like a **PowerPoint slide version (with formatting suggestion)** or shall we move to **Slide 5: Company Research** next?



Got it! Here's a **refined and focused version of Slide 4**, with only the interview insights that directly tie into the **predictive solution**, such as churn alerts, dealer monitoring, territory-level forecasting, KPI visibility, and user-centric dashboard needs.

### **Slide 4: Interview Insights – Aligned with Predictive Solution Goals**  
_Insights synthesized from AM and TSE interviews, highlighting pain points and asks that informed the predictive engine design._

---

📌 **Demand for Predictive KPIs**  
- Strong interest in forecast-based metrics such as:  
  - Predicted sales vs target  
  - Dealer-level growth forecasting  
  - Shop share and product mix trends (e.g., shift from base to advanced emulsions)  
- Preference for forward-looking alerts:  
  - Dealers likely to enter OD soon  
  - Monthly summaries with AI-generated recommendations

📌 **Churn Risk Identification**  
- Churn seen as consistent drop in emulsion sales over 3 months, especially when coupled with competitor (e.g., Berger) growth via retail audits  
- Suggested criteria for churn alerts: heavy sales drops, risk segments, counters with increasing competitor share  

📌 **Territory & Dealer Monitoring Needs**  
- Need for territory-specific dashboards with drilldowns to product and dealer-level performance  
- Desire for daily or weekly insights on:  
  - Dealers not billed in 10+ days  
  - Dealers entering/clearing OD  
  - Advanced product penetration by territory  

📌 **Simplified & Actionable Views**  
- Request for compact summaries over granular data – grouped SmartCare categories, top-performing SKUs, and category-level splits  
- Preference for AI-powered nudges that focus AM/TSE attention on the right territories or dealers  
- Ask for concise, clear notifications — maximum of 10 per user per day
