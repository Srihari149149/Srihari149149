Territory sales teams work on reactive, static KPIs, often interpreted manually

Existing system is rule-based, not personalized or dynamic

No mechanism to prioritize dealers or territories needing attention

Insights are retrospective, missing future risks or opportunities

Overload of raw data → harder for teams to extract actionable signals quickly


KPIs are standardized across geographies, ignoring territory-specific context

Focus on reporting, not forecasting — no use of AI/ML for dealer intelligence

Sales insights are frequency-driven (daily/weekly) vs business-impact driven

Lack of integration across data types — sales, visits, audit, competition

No feedback loop from ground teams → system does not evolve or learn
Perfect — here's a **cleaned-up version** of **Slide 4: Interview Insights** without the solution-mapping column, and only including the insights that are relevant to the solution you're building. This version focuses on what the stakeholders said, keeping it sharp and concise for presentation.

### **Slide 4: Key Interview Insights**  
_Insights from AMs and TSEs – Aligned to Predictive Engine Solution_

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Shashank (AM, West)**  
- “Want OD broken down into active vs inactive dealers.”  
- “NADA targets: 5% urban, 10% upcountry – tracked monthly.”  
- “KPIs must include advanced product ratios, shop share (counter vs AP CAGR), and Emulsion-focused metrics.”  

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Yatish (AM, South)**  
- “Give me planned vs base vs actual sales – clear and monthly.”  
- “Need predictive sales estimates with targets met/progress.”  
- “SmartCare & Adhesives should be grouped under Essential Goals – less granularity, more clarity.”  

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Karthik (AM, East)**  
- “Share insights weekly – keep it structured by week.”  
- “Week 1: Dealers billed | Week 2: Product KPIs | Week 3: FP focus | Week 4: Overall view.”  
- “Okay with NADA, advanced product ratios.”  

---

#### 🧑‍💼 **Tharankeshavar (AM, South)**  
- “Churn = emulsion sales drop + competitor growth – use retail audit.”  
- “Need daily OD dealer alerts + dealers not billed in 10 days.”  
- “Limit insights to 10 max – too many notifications dilute impact.”  
- “Want consolidated views – territory → product → dealer.”  
- “App summaries + AI-based focus recommendations would help.”  

---

#### 🧑‍🔧 **TSE (Field)**  
- “OD, CR not visited, and Emulsion-not-taken alerts are most helpful.”  
- “Product shift ratios (e.g., distemper → emulsion) help pitch better.”  
- “Prefer less granularity, dropdown filters, and concise messages.”  
- “App is helpful, but Excel still rules – depends on what adds value.”
