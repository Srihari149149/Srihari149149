Geolocation - categorizing outlets based on how they buy, what sku mix level. Basically classifying based on SKU mix and business volume. Capture location and give recommendation.
 
Capture stock of competition skus in store compulsorily - stock of skus in competition. Through this you calculate market share, but also predict how my sku is doing compare to his. Eiter you are going weak or im going strong. So can incentivise to sell this more because it has organically grown and how much it can grow. - Only ITC
 
Also if some strawberry biscuit is being sold in an outlet compared to an outlet not selling strawberry biscuits, I would pick that outlet to sell my biscuit cuz already customer base is there
 
Pilot testing of new skus - A/B testing also they do. Colour code: orange. Main skus are tagged green. AI/ ML chooses which outlet to pilot in. for eg. If you test in 1000/120000 outlets it choose what to pick. Basically you want it to be as random as possible. 
 
Mondelez - distributor app can see OD and all, stock is left at distributor end can be seen by sales people. In our case, depot stock maybe can be a metric that sales people can look at. 
 
Supply chain  - ITC 
 
AI/ML - demand planning
Warehouse space utilization is less - AI will tell you it is less, and itll tell ABC vehicle to get unloaded.

Creating a platform with MR/ME to look at doctors, doctors hobbies personal info and professional info, like the research they were doing and all that. It had email marketing info, if theyre responding to their emails messages etc. 
 
Metric - RCPA in pharma. Doctor accepts maybe he can vouch for 100 prescriptions, they’ll go to the chemist and verify if its sold or not.
