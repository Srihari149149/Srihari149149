Here you go — a fully formatted, **ready-to-paste PowerPoint slide** for your **Churn Risk Insight**, matching the OD slide style:

### 🎯 Slide Title:  
**Use Case: Predicting Dealer Churn Risk Using Retail Audit + Sales Decline**

---

### 🔍 Business Problem:
- Managers often miss early signals of **dealers slowly shifting to competitors**.  
- Current KPIs don’t flag risk until sales drop significantly.  
- Needed a predictive way to detect churn *before* it becomes visible in revenue.

---

### 🧠 Solution:
- Combined **Retail Audit data (YoY competitor growth)** with **3-month AP sales trends**.
- If competitor sales are rising while AP sales are declining, the dealer is flagged.
- Churn flag allows **targeted intervention before sales drop sharply**.

---

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- Merged 2 years of **Retail Audit data**
- Calculated **YoY growth** in competitor value per dealer
- Calculated **3-month slope** of AP sales using regression
- Flagged churn risk where:
  - `competitor_growth > 0`
  - `sales_slope < 0`

---

### 💡 Model Logic:
> **Churn Risk = 1**, if  
> 📈 Competitor sales are increasing (YoY)  
> 📉 AP sales trend is negative (past 3 months)

---

### 🧾 Example Case:
> **Dealer Code:** 401238  
> **Competitor Growth:** +25% (YoY)  
> **AP Sales Trend (Slope):** -0.4  
> 🔔 **Model Output:** Churn Risk = 1  
> ✅ ASM can intervene with offers or focused visits

---

### 📈 Business Value:
- Prevents churn by catching early warning signs  
- Helps ASMs prioritize at-risk dealers across territories  
- Adds predictive capability missing from standard dashboards

---

### 🖼 Screenshot Suggestions:
1. Table showing **competitor_growth**, **sales_slope**, **churn_risk**
2. One flagged dealer row as example (like 401238)
3. Optional: Sales trend graph over 3 months (if visual is needed)
