Here you go — a fully formatted, **ready-to-paste PowerPoint slide** for your **Churn Risk Insight**, matching the OD slide style:

---

### 🎯 Slide Title:  
**Use Case: Predicting Dealer Churn Risk Using Retail Audit + Sales Decline**

---

### 🔍 Business Problem:
- Managers often miss early signals of **dealers slowly shifting to competitors**.  
- Current KPIs don’t flag risk until sales drop significantly.  
- Needed a predictive way to detect churn *before* it becomes visible in revenue.

---

### 🧠 Solution:
- Combined **Retail Audit data (YoY competitor growth)** with **3-month AP sales trends**.
- If competitor sales are rising while AP sales are declining, the dealer is flagged.
- Churn flag allows **targeted intervention before sales drop sharply**.

---

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- Merged 2 years of **Retail Audit data**
- Calculated **YoY growth** in competitor value per dealer
- Calculated **3-month slope** of AP sales using regression
- Flagged churn risk where:
  - `competitor_growth > 0`
  - `sales_slope < 0`

---

### 💡 Model Logic:
> **Churn Risk = 1**, if  
> 📈 Competitor sales are increasing (YoY)  
> 📉 AP sales trend is negative (past 3 months)

---

### 🧾 Example Case:
> **Dealer Code:** 401238  
> **Competitor Growth:** +25% (YoY)  
> **AP Sales Trend (Slope):** -0.4  
> 🔔 **Model Output:** Churn Risk = 1  
> ✅ ASM can intervene with offers or focused visits

---

### 📈 Business Value:
- Prevents churn by catching early warning signs  
- Helps ASMs prioritize at-risk dealers across territories  
- Adds predictive capability missing from standard dashboards

---

### 🖼 Screenshot Suggestions:
1. Table showing **competitor_growth**, **sales_slope**, **churn_risk**
2. One flagged dealer row as example (like 401238)
3. Optional: Sales trend graph over 3 months (if visual is needed)


Great! Let’s combine both insights — **Advanced Ratio Push Potential** and **Advanced Ratio Drop Despite Sales Stability** — into a single, cohesive slide. I’ll also include the value addition over what TSEs already see (just the KPI).

---

### 🎯 **Slide Title:**  
**Advanced Ratio Intelligence: Who to Push, Who’s Dropping**

---

### 🔍 **Business Problem**
- TSEs currently see **advanced ratio KPIs** per dealer — but it’s static and lacks **interpretation or prediction**.
- No mechanism to:
  1. Identify **dealers ready to push advanced paints**, or  
  2. Detect **dealers dropping advanced products despite strong sales**.

---

### 🧠 **Solution**
Built **two AI-powered insights** from product ratio trends and sales behavior:

---

#### 🔷 **1. Push Potential Insight**
> Identifies dealers where:
> - ✅ Advanced ratio is steadily rising (≥ +5% slope)
> - ✅ Sales value or volume is also increasing
> - ✅ Growth is due to advanced product pickup, not base product drop

**📌 Example:**  
Dealer **228614**  
📈 Advanced Ratio Trend: +6.2%  
📦 Sales Volume: Stable  
🔔 Recommendation: *"Push more advanced products to this dealer"*

---

#### 🔻 **2. Advanced Ratio Drop Insight**
> Flags dealers who:
> - Had a **flat or rising ratio** earlier (months 6–3)
> - But show a **decline in advanced ratio in recent 3 months**
> - ⚠️ Sales volume remains stable → not a demand issue

**📌 Example:**  
Dealer **301278**  
📉 Advanced Ratio Drop: -4.8%  
📦 Sales Volume: Increasing  
🔔 Insight: *"Dealer reducing advanced product mix despite stable sales — consider re-engagement"*

---

### 📈 **Techniques Used**
- Mapped products using code prefixes (Advanced vs Base)
- Filtered for “AT” product mix only
- Calculated:
  - Advanced ratio = A / (A + B)
  - Rolling 6-month linear regression slope for ratio, value, volume
- Split ratio trend into:
  - Early phase (6–3 months)
  - Recent phase (last 3 months)

---

### 💡 **Why This Adds Value**
| TSE Currently Sees... | This Insight Adds... |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Only raw advanced ratio (%) | 📈 Trend over time |
| No direction on action | 🎯 Push or pull-back recommendations |
| No future-oriented prediction | 🔮 Dealer-level nudges based on behavior patterns |

---

### 📸 **Suggested Screenshots:**
- Table with:
  - `dealer_code`, `adv_ratio_slope`, `value_slope`, `push_potential`, `drop_flag`
- Notifications generated
- Optional: Trend chart for a dealer showing 6-month trajectory

Let me know if you'd like a **Mermaid flowchart** to show how both these insights are generated in your notebook — or we can move to the final one: **Engagement Drop**.

Let me know when you’re ready for the **Engagement Drop** slide — we can keep the same high-impact format.
